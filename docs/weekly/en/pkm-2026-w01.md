## TheBrain

**15.0.98**

All-new tree view extends a familiar UI to support associative connections.

January 2, 2026


**New Features**

* Tree View
  * A new navigation mode that displays your brain in a virtual hierarchy
  * The home thought, pins, types and tags appear as root nodes in the tree
  * Child thoughts are shown directly below their parents
  * Thoughts can appear in multiple spots in the tree
  * Multiple parents and jumps are visualized within the tree and can be browsed by expanding the special nodes in the tree
  * Press the `Locate Active Thought` button to highlight the active thought in the tree
* Mapped links section in content area
  * Now always visible when not in plex navigation mode
  * Rendered using the tree view to enable greater interactivity
* Card View
  * New modes: Recently Modified, Recently Accessed, and Selected Thoughts
  * `Go to Today` command quickly navigates to today's cards
  * `Locate Active Thought` command highlights the active thought in card view


**Fixes and Improvements**

* Tab improvements
  * Tabs show full brain and thought name on hover
* Improved paste behavior
  * Pasting a copied thought pastes the entire thought, not just the name
  * Markdown is detected when pasting and converted automatically
  * Pasting into code blocks or inline code always uses plain text
* Improved tab restore and creation behavior
* Detect "locked directory" of brain folder on open
* Fixed: Embedded browser does not work
* Live resizing of splitter bars for smoother UI adjustments
* Each navigation mode (Plex/Tree/Card) retains its own layout settings (splitter size, orientation, and maximized state)
* Fixed: Thoughts are missing despite room being available to show them
* Notes: Fixed: == inside of inline code caused exception during load
* Fixed: Types cannot be selected via keyboard once they have all been filtered out by typing
* Fixed: Window did not close when closing the last brains list tab
